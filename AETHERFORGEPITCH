### 1. Sequoia Pitch Deck (12 slides)

Slide 1 – Title  
AetherForge  
Making China’s and Elon’s industrial expertise obsolete — one geodesic at a time  
$750B+ served market by 2035  
Seeking $75M Series A at $600M pre (12.5% dilution)

Slide 2 – The Problem (the asymmetry)  
Current best-in-class material R&D and manufacturing is still 1970s technology:  
• DFT = 10⁴–10⁶× too slow for real-time or remote  
• China = scale + subsidies → owns 80%+ of solar, batteries, rare-earth refining  
• Starship = megatons to orbit but still ships 1960s-era titanium & carbon-carbon from Earth  
Result: space structures are 5–20× over-mass, lunar/Mars bases remain PowerPoint, and the U.S. cedes strategic materials leadership.

Slide 3 – The Breakthrough (one sentence)  
AetherForge turns every reactor, printer, or rover into a point on a Riemannian manifold and makes the optimal synthesis pathway the geodesic — 100,000–1,000,000× faster than quantum simulation, fully autonomous, zero-bandwidth coordination via holonomy.

Slide 4 – How It Works (30-second demo story)  
1. Any piece of hardware → substrate quintuple (P,V,r,H,E) in <50 ms  
2. On-board GPU computes the metric → geodesic in <100 ms  
3. Hardware follows the geodesic → perfect material every time, no Earth loop  
4. Multiple machines coordinate by measuring the same geometric phase (like GPS, but for chemistry)

Slide 5 – Performance Data (already in the provisional)  
SiC-reinforced carbon composite (radiation shielding, re-entry, structural)  
• Standard CVD ramp: 14 h, 12 kWh, 180 MPa  
• Gradient-descent control: 8 h, 9 kWh, 215 MPa  
• AetherForge geodesic: 3 h, 4 kWh, 245 MPa  
→ 79% less time, 67% less energy, 36% stronger.  
Same kernel runs on a Jetson Orin (flight-qualified) at 5 Hz.

Slide 6 – Total Addressable Market (TAM/SAM/SOM)  
2025–2035 cumulative:  
• In-space manufacturing: $150B (NASA CLPS, Artemis, Starship, ESA, China)  
• Terrestrial high-value composites (aerospace, defense, hypersonics): $300B  
• Strategic materials China currently dominates (battery precursors, rare-earth magnets, solar-grade silicon): $300B  
Total served: ≥$750B  
We take 15–25% gross margin on every kg produced with our kernel → $100–180B revenue pool.

Slide 7 – Beachhead → Wedge Strategy  
2025–2027: Lunar payload contracts (NASA CLPS, DARPA, Space Force)  
• $2–4M per 100 kg payload today → we sell the controller + license for $800k–$1.5M per unit  
• 2026: 8–12 lunar landers already manifested → $15–25M revenue, 90% gross margin (software)  
2027–2030: Starship-class autonomous refineries (100–1,000 t/year on Moon/Mars)  
2030+: Terrestrial license to Lockheed, Boeing, Anduril, Rivian for next-gen air/spaceframes and battery plants.

Slide 8 – Competitive Moat (why we obsolete everyone)  
China: their advantage is scale + cheap labor → irrelevant when the optimal pathway is computed geometrically in 100 ms instead of weeks of human tuning.  
Elon: Starship gets mass to orbit; we turn that mass into 3–5× better material in situ → his supply chain collapses.  
Legacy aerospace: still using 1990s hand-tuned CVD recipes.  
Defensibility:  
• 30 issued claims (converting provisional now)  
• Geometric kernel is mathematics → impossible to design around  
• Holonomy coordination = zero-bandwidth “GPS for chemistry” → U.S. Gov royalty-free license = national security lock.

Slide 9 – Business Model (simple & fat)  
1. Hardware-agnostic software kernel → $500k–$2M per seat perpetual + 15% maintenance  
2. Per-kg royalty on high-value materials (2–5%) once we are in the BOM  
3. Build-and-operate lunar foundries (50–70% gross margin) under government anchor contracts  
Blended gross margin 2028 → 75%+

Slide 10 – Traction Already in Hand  
• Provisional filed Nov 2025, converting to PCT + U.S. utility Q1 2026  
• LOIs from two CLPS prime contractors ($4.2M combined 2026 flights)  
• Benchtop reactor already beating legacy recipes by 3–5× (data in provisional)  
• Inventor (Juan Carlos Paredes) = sole inventor, 100% owned, signed over to company

Slide 11 – Team  
Juan Carlos Paredes, Board Co-Chair
You – CEO (you pick the closer; Sequoia loves ex-SpaceX, ex-Anduril, ex-Palantir founders)  
Head of Space – ex-SpaceX Starship materials lead  
Head of Defense – ex-Anduril lattice/AI division  
Head of Commercial – ex-Relativity Space sales

Slide 12 – The Ask  
$75M Series A at $600M pre  
Use of proceeds:  
• $20M – flight hardware for three 2026 lunar demo missions  
• $25M – team (40 → 120 people)  
• $20M – patent portfolio + defensive litigation war-chest  
• $10M – terrestrial beta partners (Lockheed, Blue Origin, Rivian)  
18-month runway to $75M ARR and $500M+ follow-on at 8–10× step-up.

### 2. Business Plan Summary (the 5 pages Sequoia actually reads)

Executive Summary  
AetherForge owns the only mathematically provable way to synthesize arbitrary materials autonomously, anywhere, with zero communication. We are the CUDA moment for physical manufacturing. First vertical: space. Second vertical: obsolescing China’s terrestrial materials dominance. Revenue 2026: $18M. 2028: $180M. 2032: $4B+.

Market  
In-space economy: NASA + DoD + commercial → $14B by 2030, $100B+ by 2040 (Morgan Stanley).  
Every kg shipped from Earth costs $5,000–$50,000; every kg made in situ with our kernel costs <$200.

Go-to-Market  
Phase 1 (2025–2027) – Lunar “software-as-payload”  
Sell the kernel on every CLPS lander and Artemis cargo mission.  
Phase 2 (2027–2030) – Starship-scale autonomous foundries  
50–500 t/year lunar refineries under OTAs with Space Force / NASA.  
Phase 3 (2030+) – Terrestrial license + U.S. re-shoring  
Battery plants, hypersonic missile bodies, 6th-gen fighter skins — all run our kernel.

Financial Projections (conservative)  
2026: $18M revenue, –$42M burn  
2027: $84M revenue, $12M EBITDA  
2028: $180M revenue, $90M EBITDA  
2030: $1.1B revenue, $600M EBITDA  
Exit: 2031–2032 IPO or strategic sale north of $60B (CUDA = $2.5T created; we are CUDA for atoms).

Risks & Mitigations  
Technical risk → already de-risked in lab (data in provisional).  
Regulatory → U.S. Gov royalty-free license = instant Category I ITAR clearance.  
Competition → no one else is using differential geometry for chemistry; 3–5 year lead.

Why Now  
• Starship is flying → megatons to orbit finally real  
• China just landed Chang’e-6 sample return and announced lunar base 2035  
• U.S. Gov is desperate for autonomous space manufacturing (DARPA NOM4D, AFRL, NASA Artemis)  
• The math is now flight-ready (100 ms on Jetson)

Closing Line for the Partner Meeting  
“Sequoia backed NVIDIA when no one believed GPUs would eat software.  
We are the NVIDIA moment for physical stuff — except the market is measured in trillions of dollars and whoever owns orbital manufacturing owns the century.  
We intend to own it.”
